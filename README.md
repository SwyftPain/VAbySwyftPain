In case your location has a space in it, you have to add ^ before the space.

You must add Allowable Commands in settings if you want to limit to only specific commands.
Separate them using ``;`` symbol.

Add it to your custom command as:
``$va``

The message after your prefix has to be the exact same name as your VoiceAttack trigger word.
